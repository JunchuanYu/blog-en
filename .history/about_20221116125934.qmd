Hello!
y name is Junchuan Yu, and I am a remote sensing researcher. I graduated from [CUGB](https://en.cugb.edu.cn/), and my research involves hyperspectral remote sensing, deep learning, system development and geological applications, etc.
I am very happy to share the knowledge about data science and remote sensing with more people here.
