#    Sydney-AI 2.0: Providing Free Services to Researchers!
n the past month, ChatGPT has been applied to various scenarios and brought many wonderful ideas and new experiences. As artificial intelligence enters a new technological inflection point, people's understanding and expectations of AI have changed, gradually realizing that the application and inheritance of knowledge are changing. Self-education and lifelong learning will become the consensus of this generation. The ability to handle new tools will be the key to whether the future can enter the fast lane of development.

Against this backdrop, we recently built a web-based ChatGPT software called Sydney-AI based on the OpenAI-released ChatGPT-3.5-turbo API, with the aim of providing free services to our "45-degree researchers" friends. Many friends have given feedback that ChatGPT has indeed helped them a lot in their daily work and study, and have also put forward some improvement suggestions for Sydney-AI.

Today, we introduce the upgraded version of Sydney-AI, mainly targeting the visualization of output results and prompt improvement. Software optimization is a continuous process, and we hope that you can discover and solve problems with us while experiencing the software. The operating costs of the platform are borne by the "45-degree researchers" public account. Thank you for your support! Follow the public account and reply "chat" to get the upgrade version of Sydney-AI link address.

## What are the benefits of Sydney-AI for researchers？
ChatGPT is an excellent research assistant software that has impressive performance in data collection, language polishing, development assistance, and text editing. In the past month, our team members have become accustomed to working with Sydney-AI. If you want to learn more about ChatGPT or New Bing, please read our previous review article：[New Bing？也许是New + Everything！](https://junchuanyu.netlify.app/posts/2023-3-4newbing/)。

## Function upgrades
 Our goal in developing this application is to make it convenient for everyone to use ChatGPT, and Sydney-AI's characteristic is to solve the problem of using ChatGPT under the domestic network environment. The main upgrades of the new version are as follows:

- Optimized the display of output results. The original version had garbled characters in the output results, especially when dealing with code, which could not be displayed correctly. The upgraded version parses the output results and displays them in Markdown format.

- Added Chinese prompt options. The preset prompts in the original version are in English and have many useless roles. The upgraded version includes commonly used prompts such as Chinese and English translation, text summarization, mid-journey prompt generation, etc. At the same time, users can fill in custom prompts to avoid the trouble of repeatedly writing prompts for each conversation. If you have any good chatgpt prompt recommendations, please contact us.

- Added conversation record export function. For scenes involving code and tables, having an export function is more convenient for use. The export format is Markdown.

## How to use Sydney-AI？
### Basic settings：
- There is no limit on the number of conversations, but there is a limit of 3500 tokens per conversation. Exceeding this limit will require starting a new conversation. Note that tokens are not the same as words, as 1000 tokens is roughly equivalent to 750 words.

- Sydney-AI is available for free to followers of the "45度科研人" official account. The app comes with the OpenAI API key built-in, but please note that OpenAI limits the number of queries that can be made with a single key during a given time interval (which may be one hour). This may cause errors when multiple users are using the app at the same time. Additionally, access to the HF website from within China may be intermittent. To improve your user experience, you can enter your own API key in the API Key window.

- The software includes a number of commonly used ChatGPT roles that can be selected from the dropdown menu, with the default setting being the original ChatGPT. You can also add descriptions of roles you want ChatGPT to play in your input text.

The presets for the software roles are as follows:

<div style="text-align:center;">
<table>

| NO. | Role| NO. | Role |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|1| ChatGPT|2| English-Chinese Translation
|
|3| English Polishing	|4| Oral Practice

### Method of use
- Please input your question in the text box and click "submit". In the Custom prompt tab of ChatGPT, you can specify the role that the robot will play in both Chinese and English. You can also select some commonly used prompts from "load from template".

- Alternatively, you can customize the prompt in the Custom prompt window, which mainly includes three aspects: the role of the AI, the rules of engagement, and the expected results. For example, if you are an English teacher, I will provide you with some sentences and phrases, and you should check if there are any grammatical or spelling errors. If there are, please list them in a table format.

- To save the chat history, please provide a filename of your choice in the Settings tab and click "save". The app will generate a file in Markdown format, and you can click "download" to retrieve it.-
